			<p>  When Henry Hudson sailed into New York City, he happened upon one of the world’s most impressive natural harbors. He saw whales, turtles, otters, and countless other marine life. However, what he did not see, were the 220,000 acres of oyster beds below the surface of the water.</p>

			<p> In 1715, there were originally laws that seeked to preserve the populations of oysters. Way before hot dogs and pizza, oysters served as the original street food of New York. Oysters were so ubiquitous that “New Yorkers had no other substance than oysters and bread.” Oysters also served as construction material that contributed to the construction of the building of the Trinity Church. Howeverby 1807, the legislation was suspended.  </p>

			<p> As people continued to consume and harvest more oysters, deposit raw sewage into the waters, and the expansion of the harbors, oyster populations plummeted. By 1927, the last commercial oyster bed in New York City closes. For more than half a century, new york harbor becomes nearly lifeless and is associated with filth and disease.</p>
