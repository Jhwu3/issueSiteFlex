			<p> Through their natural feeding process, oysters filter water for algae and nitrogen . This process removes excess nitrogen by incorporating it into their shells. Which prevents algae blooms that reduce oxygen levels in the water. One adult oyster is capable of filtering up to 50 gallons of water a day. </p>
